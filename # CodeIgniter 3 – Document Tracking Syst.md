# CodeIgniter 3 – Document Tracking System

## 1. Project Objective

Migrate and develop the **Document Tracking System** using **CodeIgniter 3** with a structured MVC architecture, service-based business logic, role-based permissions, document lifecycle management, hardcopy/softcopy document tracking, configurable approval workflows, audit logging, notifications, and document access control.

The system supports two separate document domains:

1. **Softcopy / Electronic Documents**
2. **Hardcopy / Physical Documents**

Softcopy and hardcopy documents have different business rules and data structures but share common infrastructure such as:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Roles and permissions
* Workflow execution
* Audit logging
* Notifications
* Document assignment
* Access control
* Status history

---

# 2. Phase 1 – CodeIgniter 3 Setup and Architecture

## 2.1 MVC Architecture

The application will use the CodeIgniter 3 MVC architecture:

* Controllers
* Models
* Views
* Libraries
* Helpers
* Services
* Repositories/Data Access Layer where appropriate

Controllers should remain thin and should primarily handle:

* HTTP request handling
* Input validation
* Authentication checks
* Authorization checks
* Calling application services
* Returning views or API responses

Business rules must be implemented in application/domain services rather than being placed directly inside controllers.

## 2.2 Core Services

The application should provide dedicated services for major business processes:

* Authentication Service
* User Management Service
* Role Service
* Permission Service
* Softcopy Document Service
* Hardcopy Document Service
* Document Revision Service
* Hardcopy Transfer Service
* Document Access Service
* Document Disposal Service
* Workflow Service
* Notification Service
* Audit Log Service

---

# 3. Phase 2 – Authentication, Roles and Permissions

## 3.1 Authentication

The system provides internal user authentication.

There is **no public user registration**.

Users cannot create their own accounts.

User accounts are created and managed by authorized administrators.

The authentication system must support:

* Username/password login
* Logout
* Password change
* Forced password change
* Password hashing
* Session management
* Login auditing

---

# 4. Roles

The system must support configurable roles.

Initial roles:

* Plant Manager
* Document Control Officer
* Internal Auditor
* Administrator
* Staff

Roles must not be hardcoded into the application wherever possible.

Administrators should be able to:

* Create roles
* Edit roles
* Activate/deactivate roles
* Assign permissions to roles

---

# 5. Role-Based Permissions

Permissions are structured as:

**Module → Action**

Supported actions initially include:

* View
* Add
* Edit
* Delete
* Request
* Approve

Additional actions can be added later.

Each permission contains:

* Permission Name
* Module Key
* Module Label
* Action Key
* Action Label
* Description

Relationship:

```text
Role
  ↓
Role Permission
  ↓
Permission
```

A role can have many permissions.

A permission can be assigned to many roles.

---

# 6. Phase 3 – User Management

## 6.1 User Account

Each user contains:

* User ID
* Username
* First Name
* Middle Name
* Last Name
* Position Title
* Role
* Password Hash
* Require Password Change
* Leader/Supervisor
* Created At
* Updated At

Users may have a leader/supervisor relationship:

```text
User
  ↓
Leader/Supervisor
  ↓
Another User
```

This supports organizational hierarchy.

---

# 7. User Creation

Only authorized users, initially administrators, can create user accounts.

There is no:

* Public registration
* Account registration request
* Self-registration approval
* Registration workflow

When an administrator creates a user:

1. System generates an initial password.
2. System hashes the password.
3. Plain-text password is not stored.
4. `require_password_change` is set to `true`.
5. Administrator securely provides the initial password to the user.
6. User logs in.
7. User is required to change the password.

---

# 8. Password Management

The change-password screen contains:

* Current Password
* New Password
* Confirm New Password

Passwords must always be stored as secure password hashes.

Plain-text passwords must never be stored in the database.

Password-related operations should be audited.

---

# 9. Phase 4 – Organizational and Location Management

The system maintains organizational and physical-location information required for hardcopy tracking.

## 9.1 Area

An Area represents a major organizational or physical grouping.

Examples:

* Production
* Quality
* Warehouse
* Administration

Relationship:

```text
Area
 └── Specific
```

One Area may have many Specific records.

---

# 10. Specific

A Specific represents a subdivision of an Area.

Relationship:

```text
Area 1 ──── N Specific
```

Specific records may be used by:

* Hardcopy documents
* Assets
* Physical locations
* Transfer requests

---

# 11. Location

A Location represents the actual physical location where a hardcopy document is stored.

Location contains:

* Location ID
* Location Name
* Location Code
* Active/Inactive Status
* Archive Date
* Specific
* Asset
* Created At
* Updated At

For hardcopy document tracking, the relationship is:

```text
HardcopyDocument 1 ──── 1 Location
```

A hardcopy document has **one current physical Location**.

A Location belongs to one current HardcopyDocument.

The location is therefore a dedicated physical storage record for the hardcopy.

Historical movements are preserved through the transfer history rather than by storing multiple current locations on the hardcopy record.

---

# 12. Asset Numbers

Physical assets can be registered.

Each asset contains:

* Asset ID
* Asset Number
* Specific
* Created At

Assets may be associated with hardcopy documents.

---

# 13. Phase 5 – Document Architecture

Softcopy and hardcopy documents are intentionally separated.

They must **not share a single large document table containing unrelated fields**.

The system uses separate domain models:

```text
SoftcopyDocument
      │
      ├── Category
      ├── Revisions
      ├── Attachments
      └── Artifacts


HardcopyDocument
      │
      ├── Area
      ├── Specific
      ├── Asset Number
      ├── Location
      ├── Optional Sequence
      ├── Retention
      └── Physical Attachments
```

Common request/workflow infrastructure may reference the appropriate document entity.

---

# 14. Softcopy Document Management

A SoftcopyDocument represents an electronic/controlled document.

Softcopy information includes:

* Document ID
* Document Number
* Series Number
* Document Title
* Document Category
* Current Revision
* Revision History
* Attachments

Softcopy documents are managed through document control and revision processes.

---

# 15. Softcopy Categories

Softcopy categories support hierarchical organization.

Example:

```text
Quality
├── Procedures
├── Forms
└── Work Instructions
```

Each category contains:

* Category Name
* Folder Name
* Description
* Active/Inactive Status
* Parent Category
* Creator
* Created At
* Updated At

Relationship:

```text
Parent Category
      │
      └── Subcategory
```

---

# 16. Softcopy Revisions

Every softcopy revision must be preserved.

A revision contains:

* Revision Number
* Reason for Revision
* Effective Date
* Page Number
* Series Number
* Document Title
* Previous Revision Level
* New Revision Level
* Previous Effective Date
* New Effective Date
* Date Received
* Date Released
* Approval Date
* Current/Historical Status
* File Name
* File Path
* File Size
* MIME Type
* Uploaded By
* Approved By
* Approved At

Only one revision should be the current revision.

Previous revisions remain historical records.

---

# 17. Softcopy Attachments

Softcopy attachments support approval.

Statuses:

* Pending Approval
* Approved
* Rejected
* Cancelled

Attachment information:

* File Name
* File Path
* File Size
* MIME Type
* Uploaded By
* Approved By
* Approved At
* Rejected By
* Rejected At
* Rejection Reason
* Created At

---

# 18. Softcopy Revision Artifacts

The system may generate controlled and uncontrolled artifacts.

Artifact types:

* Controlled
* Uncontrolled

Each artifact records:

* Revision
* Artifact Type
* File Name
* File Path
* File Size
* MIME Type
* Source Fingerprint
* Generator Version
* Created At
* Updated At

This provides traceability between generated files and their source revision.

---

# 19. Phase 6 – Hardcopy Document Management

Hardcopy documents are physical documents.

A HardcopyDocument contains only information relevant to the physical document.

Required fields:

* Hardcopy ID
* Document Title
* Area
* Specific
* Asset Number
* Location

Optional:

* Sequence Number

Additional physical-management fields:

* Retention Enabled
* Retention Start Date
* Retention End Date

Attachments may also be associated with the hardcopy.

---

# 20. Hardcopy Document Structure

The hardcopy relationship is:

```text
HardcopyDocument
      │
      ├── Document Title
      │
      ├── Area
      │
      ├── Specific
      │
      ├── Asset Number
      │
      ├── Location
      │
      └── Optional Sequence
```

The primary physical-location relationship is:

```text
HardcopyDocument 1 ──── 1 Location
```

The sequence is optional:

```text
HardcopyDocument 1 ──── 0..1 Sequence
```

The Area is required.

Specific, Asset Number, and Location relationships should follow the actual operational requirement and database constraints.

---

# 21. Hardcopy Creation

Hardcopy creation is separate from softcopy document creation.

A hardcopy creation request contains the physical-document information required to register the hardcopy.

Initial fields:

* Document Title
* Area
* Specific
* Asset Number
* Location
* Optional Sequence
* Retention Information where applicable

Hardcopy creation must follow its own workflow.

---

# 22. Hardcopy Update

Hardcopy physical information can be updated through the appropriate request process.

Updates may include:

* Area
* Specific
* Asset Number
* Location
* Sequence
* Retention Information

Changes must be audited.

---

# 23. Phase 7 – Request Management

The system separates **requests** from **actual document records**.

A request represents an action that must be processed.

The resulting document represents the actual controlled document.

---

# 24. Core Request Types

The system supports:

## 24.1 Softcopy Document Control Request

Used for:

* Create
* Revise
* Cancel

## 24.2 Hardcopy Create/Update Request

Used for:

* Create hardcopy
* Update hardcopy

## 24.3 Hardcopy Transfer Request

Used for:

* Transfer physical document
* Change physical location
* Assign physical document to another recipient

## 24.4 Softcopy Document Assignment Request

Used to assign a softcopy document to a user.

## 24.5 Document Access Request

Used to request controlled access.

## 24.6 Document Disposal Request

Used to request document disposal.

---

# 25. Request-Based Creation

Normal users submit requests.

Example:

```text
Staff
   │
   ▼
Request
   │
   ▼
Workflow
   │
   ▼
Approvers
   │
   ▼
Document Controller
   │
   ▼
Document Creation/Update
```

The request and resulting document must remain traceable to each other.

---

# 26. Direct Creation

Direct creation/update is separate from request-based creation.

Initially, direct creation is restricted to:

* Administrator
* Document Control Officer

Direct creation must:

* Bypass the normal request form where authorized
* Still perform all required validation
* Create the document directly
* Record the creation source
* Record the creation reason
* Create audit records

Example:

```text
Administrator
      │
      ▼
Direct Document Creation
      │
      ▼
Document
      │
      ▼
Audit Log
```

---

# 27. Phase 8 – Hardcopy Transfer Management

Hardcopy transfers use a dedicated transfer request.

A transfer request contains:

## Current Information

* Area
* Specific
* Asset Number
* Location
* Sequence

## Destination Information

* Area
* Specific
* Asset Number
* Location
* Sequence

## Transfer Information

* Document Copy Number
* Current Holder
* Transfer To
* Reason
* Requested By
* Recipient
* Transfer Date
* Comments

---

# 28. Hardcopy Transfer Workflow

Transfer status:

* Draft
* For Approval
* Approved
* For Transfer
* Transferred
* Pending Recipient Acceptance
* Completed
* Returned
* Rejected
* Cancelled

After physical transfer, the recipient must confirm receipt.

Recipient status:

* Pending
* Accepted
* Refused

The system records:

* Recipient
* Accepted By
* Acceptance Date
* Acceptance Status

---

# 29. Hardcopy Location Updates After Transfer

After a successful transfer and acceptance, the HardcopyDocument's current Location is updated.

Example:

```text
Before Transfer

Hardcopy
   ↓
Location A


Transfer
   ↓
Approval
   ↓
Physical Movement
   ↓
Recipient Acceptance
   ↓


After Transfer

Hardcopy
   ↓
Location B
```

The transfer history preserves the previous location.

Therefore:

* HardcopyDocument = current location
* TransferHistory = historical movement

---

# 30. Phase 9 – Document Access Requests

Users may request access to controlled documents.

An access request contains:

* Document
* Requester
* Request Reason
* Status
* Reviewer
* Approver
* Approval Stage
* Reviewer Remarks
* Granted Date
* Revoked Date
* Expiration Date

Statuses:

* Pending
* For Access Approval
* Approved
* Access Granted
* Returned
* Rejected
* Cancelled
* Revoked
* Expired

Every access request maintains a complete history.

---

# 31. Phase 10 – Document Disposal

The system supports disposal requests.

Disposal request information:

* Document
* Requester
* Disposal Remarks
* Disposal Action
* Reviewer
* Review Remarks
* Review Date
* Status

Disposal actions:

* Shred
* Scratch
* Reuse
* Other

Statuses:

* Pending
* Approved
* Rejected

Before disposal, the system must preserve the previous document status.

The system records:

* Disposal Date
* Disposed By
* Disposal Action
* Disposal Remarks

---

# 32. Phase 11 – Document Assignment

Documents can be assigned to users.

Assignment contains:

* Document
* Assigned User
* Assigned By
* Assigned Date

Assignment is separate from workflow approval.

A user may therefore have:

* Assigned Documents
* Approval Tasks
* Submitted Requests

These are separate concepts.

---

# 33. Phase 12 – Workflow Builder

The system provides a configurable Workflow Builder.

The Workflow Builder is used by authorized administrators to create approval processes.

It supports:

* Workflow Definitions
* Workflow Versions
* Draft Workflows
* Published Workflows
* Archived Workflows
* Workflow Nodes
* Approval Stages
* User Assignment
* Role Assignment
* Permission-Based Assignment
* Conditions
* Approval Paths
* Rejection Paths
* Return Paths

---

# 34. Workflow Definition

A workflow definition contains:

* Workflow Key
* Name
* Description
* Document Type
* Active Status
* Created By
* Created At
* Updated At

Structure:

```text
Workflow Definition
        │
        ├── Version 1
        ├── Version 2
        └── Version 3
```

---

# 35. Workflow Versioning

Each workflow can contain multiple versions.

Example:

```text
Document Creation Workflow

Version 1 – Archived
Version 2 – Archived
Version 3 – Published
Version 4 – Draft
```

Statuses:

* Draft
* Published
* Archived

Only published versions are used for new production requests.

---

# 36. Workflow Execution

When a request is submitted:

1. Identify the applicable workflow.
2. Load the published workflow version.
3. Create a workflow snapshot.
4. Generate workflow steps.
5. Assign steps to users or roles.
6. Set the current workflow step.
7. Notify the assigned approver.
8. Wait for action.
9. Process the decision.
10. Move to the next node.
11. Continue until completion.

Supported decisions:

* Approve
* Reject
* Return for Correction
* Cancel

---

# 37. Workflow Assignment

Workflow steps may be assigned using:

* Specific User
* Role
* Permission
* Workflow Configuration
* Other configurable assignment rules

The system stores snapshots of:

* Assigned User Name
* Position Title

This ensures historical records remain accurate even if the user's profile changes.

---

# 38. Workflow Assignment History

When an administrator changes an assigned approver, the system preserves the previous assignment.

History records:

* Previous User
* New User
* Changed By
* Previous User Name
* New User Name
* New Position
* Reason
* Change Date

---

# 39. Workflow Step History

Workflow steps record:

* Status
* Decision
* Comments
* Assigned User
* Acting User
* Assignment Time
* Action Time
* Acting User Name Snapshot
* Acting Position Snapshot

This creates a complete approval trail.

---

# 40. Document-Specific Approvers

The system supports document-specific approver configuration.

Possible approvers include:

* Noted By
* Plant Manager
* Document Controller
* Hardcopy Approver
* Access Approver
* Document Owner

Configuration can contain:

* Workflow Name
* Workflow Version
* Workflow Plan
* Configured By
* Created At
* Updated At

This provides flexibility for documents requiring specific approval participants.

---

# 41. My Requests

**My Requests** displays requests submitted by the current user.

Information includes:

* Request Reference
* Document
* Request Type
* Date Submitted
* Current Status
* Current Workflow Stage
* Current Approver
* Approval History
* Comments
* Final Result

Typical statuses:

* Draft
* Pending Approval
* Approved
* Returned for Correction
* Rejected
* Completed
* Cancelled

---

# 42. My Tasks

**My Tasks** displays workflow actions assigned to the current user.

A task may exist because the user was selected as:

* Approver
* Reviewer
* Noted By
* Plant Manager
* Document Controller
* Access Approver
* Hardcopy Approver
* Other Workflow Participant

Task information includes:

* Request
* Document
* Requester
* Workflow Stage
* Date Assigned
* Current Status
* Required Action

Available actions depend on the user's permissions and workflow configuration.

---

# 43. Audit Logging

The system maintains an immutable audit log for important operations.

Audit records contain:

* User
* Username
* Role
* Action
* Module
* Description
* HTTP Method
* Path
* Entity ID
* Metadata
* Before State
* After State
* Reason
* Workflow Context
* IP Address
* User Agent
* Created At

Audited actions include:

* Login
* Logout
* User Creation
* User Update
* Password Change
* Permission Change
* Document Creation
* Document Update
* Document Revision
* Document Approval
* Document Rejection
* Document Transfer
* Document Disposal
* Workflow Modification
* Workflow Assignment Change
* Access Grant
* Access Revocation

Audit logs cannot be edited through normal application interfaces.

---

# 44. Document Status History

Every important document status change must be recorded.

History contains:

* Previous Status
* New Status
* Action
* Performed By
* Remarks
* Date

This allows auditors to reconstruct the document lifecycle.

---

# 45. Notifications

The system provides notifications for important events.

Examples:

* New approval task
* Request submitted
* Request approved
* Request rejected
* Request returned
* Document assigned
* Access approved
* Access revoked
* Transfer submitted
* Transfer approved
* Recipient acceptance required

The system tracks notification-read status per user.

---

# 46. Sequence Management

The system must provide centralized sequence generation.

Sequence generation must prevent duplicate numbers during concurrent transactions.

Sequences may be used for:

* Document Numbers
* Request References
* Hardcopy Sequence Numbers
* Transfer References
* Other system identifiers

The sequence service should handle concurrency safely.

---

# 47. System Appearance

The system supports centralized appearance settings.

Settings include:

* Theme Scope
* Color Mode
* Color Theme
* Additional UI Settings

Color modes:

* Light
* Dark
* System/Device

Settings are stored centrally and applied to the application interface.

---

# 51. Request vs Direct Creation

The system must maintain a strict distinction between request-based processing and direct document creation.

## Request

A normal user submits a request.

```text
User
  ↓
Request Form
  ↓
Workflow
  ↓
Approval
  ↓
Document Processing
  ↓
Document
```

## Direct Creation

An authorized administrator or Document Control Officer directly creates or updates the document.

```text
Administrator / Document Control Officer
              ↓
       Direct Creation
              ↓
           Document
              ↓
          Audit Log
```

Direct creation must still:

* Validate data
* Enforce permissions
* Record the creator
* Record creation source
* Record creation reason
* Generate audit records

---

# 52. Important Domain Separation

The application must not force softcopy and hardcopy documents into the same business model.

## Softcopy focuses on:

* Document control
* Categories
* Document numbers
* Revisions
* Files
* Controlled artifacts
* Electronic document lifecycle

## Hardcopy focuses on:

* Physical document identity
* Area
* Specific
* Asset Number
* Location
* Optional Sequence
* Physical transfer
* Recipient acceptance
* Retention
* Physical disposal

Both domains can use the shared:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Workflow
* Audit
* Notification
* Assignment
* Access control

---

# 53. Final Architectural Principle

The system should treat the workflow as a **reusable workflow engine**, not merely a list of approvers.

Every submitted request receives the workflow version that was active at the time of submission.

Example:

```text
Request #001
    ↓
Workflow Version 2
    ↓
Workflow Snapshot


Request #002
    ↓
Workflow Version 3
    ↓
Workflow Snapshot
```

If Workflow Version 3 becomes the current workflow, Request #001 must continue using its original Workflow Version 2 snapshot.

This guarantees:

* Historical accuracy
* Workflow traceability
* Auditability
* Reproducibility
* Protection against future workflow changes

---

# 54. Final Core Modules

The completed system consists of the following major modules:

1. Authentication
2. User Management
3. Role Management
4. Permission Management
5. Area Management
6. Specific Management
7. Location Management
8. Asset Management
9. Softcopy Document Management
10. Softcopy Category Management
11. Softcopy Revision Management
12. Softcopy Attachment Management

# 55. Final User Account Rule

There is **no user registration module**.

The final user-account lifecycle is:

```text
Administrator
      ↓
Create User
      ↓
Generate Initial Password
      ↓
Hash Password
      ↓
Require Password Change
      ↓
User Login
      ↓
Change Password
      ↓
Normal System Access
```

Users cannot independently register accounts.

This separation is the final domain model direction for the Document Tracking System.

Final implementation direction

Stack

CodeIgniter 3
MySQL
Bootstrap
External CSS/JavaScript
jQuery
DataTables
Server-side PHP MVC
Service layer for business logic

Architecture

Thin controllers
Models/repositories for persistence
Services for business rules
Reusable shared components
Separate Softcopy and Hardcopy domains
Shared infrastructure for authentication, authorization, workflow, audit, notification, assignment, and access control
KISS + YAGNI rules

The implementation should deliberately avoid unnecessary complexity.

KISS

Prefer straightforward CI3 patterns over elaborate abstractions.
Controllers coordinate; services execute business rules.
Keep database relationships explicit and understandable.
Avoid unnecessary design patterns when a simple service/model is sufficient.
Use centralized helpers/components instead of duplicating UI or JavaScript.

YAGNI

Build only requirements explicitly defined in the specification.
Do not add speculative modules, APIs, microservices, event buses, queues, or infrastructure unless a real requirement appears.
Do not create generic abstractions merely because something might be reused later.
Keep workflow functionality configurable, but don't turn it into an unnecessarily complex BPM platform.
Centralized reusable UI

A major implementation rule should be:

If a UI component is used more than once, centralize it rather than duplicating its markup and JavaScript.

The shared UI layer should provide reusable components for:

Modal
Confirmation dialog
Alert/toast
Upsert modal
Custom modal
Search input
Searchable dropdown
DataTables
Form validation
Loading indicator
Empty state
Error state
Page/table action controls
Common buttons
Status badges
File upload UI where applicable

For example:

application/
├── controllers/
├── models/
├── services/
├── repositories/
├── libraries/
├── helpers/
└── views/
    ├── layouts/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── modal/
    │   ├── alert/
    │   ├── confirm/
    │   ├── upsert/
    │   ├── searchable_dropdown/
    │   ├── search/
    │   ├── datatable/
    │   └── form/
    └── modules/

The exact folder structure can be adjusted during implementation, but the principle should remain.

Centralized DataTable

All list pages should use one reusable DataTable implementation rather than every module creating its own independent configuration.

Conceptually:

Reusable DataTable Component
        │
        ├── Users
        ├── Roles
        ├── Permissions
        ├── Areas
        ├── Specifics
        ├── Locations
        ├── Assets
        ├── Documents
        ├── Requests
        ├── Transfers
        ├── Access Requests
        ├── Disposal Requests
        ├── My Requests
        ├── My Tasks
        └── Audit Logs

Module-specific configuration should only define what actually differs:

columns
ajax endpoint
filters
ordering
actions
permissions
row formatting

The DataTable behavior itself stays centralized.

UI direction

The frontend should have a modern, clean SaaS/enterprise appearance, while remaining practical for an internal business system.

Design characteristics:

Clean spacing
Neutral professional color palette
Clear typography hierarchy
Minimal visual clutter
Consistent cards
Consistent tables
Compact but readable forms
Clear primary/secondary actions
Consistent status badges
Responsive layouts
Light/Dark/System theme support
Consistent modal behavior
Consistent loading/error/empty states
Minimal unnecessary animation
Strong accessibility and usability

Avoid making it look like an overly decorative marketing website. It should feel like a professional enterprise document-control application.

                         My Requests
                         My Tasks

The workflow engine remains reusable, while Softcopy and Hardcopy retain their own domain rules.

One important implementation rule

The database and code should preserve this distinction:

REQUEST ≠ DOCUMENT

A request is a business process.

A document is the resulting controlled record.

Likewise:

WORKFLOW DEFINITION
        ↓
WORKFLOW VERSION
        ↓
WORKFLOW SNAPSHOT
        ↓
WORKFLOW EXECUTION
        ↓
WORKFLOW STEP HISTORY

This is particularly important for auditability.

Final development principle

I would use this as the project's guiding rule:

Build the simplest architecture that correctly satisfies the finalized requirements, centralize genuinely reusable UI/infrastructure, keep Softcopy and Hardcopy domains separate, and avoid implementing functionality that has not been requested.
